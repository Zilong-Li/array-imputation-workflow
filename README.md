A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=Zilong-Li%2Fgenotype-imputation).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) genotype-imputationsitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `Zilong-Li` and `genotype-imputation` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `genotype-imputation` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `genotype-imputation`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `Zilong-Li` and `genotype-imputation` were correctly set.
